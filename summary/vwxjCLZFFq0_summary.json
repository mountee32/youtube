{"title": "Master-Brain works Story. Emissary Brain works Models. Iain McGilchrist and Guy Landau", "date": "2024-02-09", "summary": "The text discusses the concept of connection and relevance in relation to different levels of familiarity. It argues that the further away something is from an individual's immediate life, the deeper they have to go to find it relevant. It also explores the difference between stories and models in representing ideas, noting that stories are more profound and can be more universally understood. The text concludes by discussing how stories can be derived from models, but not vice versa, and emphasizes the importance of storytelling over dogmatic adherence to models."}
