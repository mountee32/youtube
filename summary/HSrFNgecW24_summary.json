{"title": "Elizabeth Oldfield Mugged by Jesus Pursued by the Sacred", "date": "2024-02-07", "summary": "So this interview with Paul Weber was conducted on January 12, 2022. We discussed the importance of connecting in-person with technology in various ways. Paul explores websites, podcasts, and in-person church communities to create genuine, meaningful connections. Throughout the conversation, we bat souped theological ideas, past experiences, and technological advancements, all to deepen friendships and foster fruitful, transformative conversations that highlight the significance and complexity of human beings' personal journeys traversing vast schools of thought and theological belief systems across time and space. The end goal of such practices embodies connection, understanding, growth, and a life well-lived, a life that is seen and celebrated by God and His people, experiencing life not only as it is but, perhaps, more importantly, as it could be.\n\nThank you for listening. Similarly, good conversations are welcoming to other voices. Please join in by sharing this episode or send it to a friend. Contribute to the richness of the story. You've been a part of a crucial part of the on-going project--meaning making. Care for one another, dream together, and interact with ever-increasing grace.\n\nIn the course of time, you are in our prayers. God bless you all. Amen."}
