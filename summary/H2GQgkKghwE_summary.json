Announcing Estuary Leadership Council", "date": "2024-02-08", "summary": "Paul Vander Klap mentioned a number of great points and thoughts in his recent video, and I think it's helpful for many churches, organizations, and individuals to be aware of these considerations.\n\nFirstly, planning a conference with a specific theme in mind can significantly impact the choice of speakers. It is beneficial to think about your pool of potential attendees and invest time understanding your target demographic. This way, you can select speakers who will resonate with them and possibly even inspire future connections. \n\nSecondly, a clear theme in advance can help guide your organizational structure and promotion. It can also potentially allow you to transition from online conversations to in-person gatherings, especially when planning in-person conferences. This continuous dialogue creates a seamless experience for those attending and builds a sense of community.\n\nFinally, it's crucial to emphasize your target audience when organizing a conference. Paying attention to the potential attendees and understanding which speakers can attract their interest will result in a well-received, enjoyable, and dynamic event for everyone involved.\n\nIn summary, approaching conference organization by focusing on the theme and target audience while considering various factors like technology and online interactions can make a significant impact on the overall experience. It can also help churches, organizations, and individuals in creating meaningful connections and fostering a supportive environment."}
