that the distinction between those", "two is kept very clear and apparently I", "do that so much that I've begun to sound", "like a a broken record and then I also", "wonder what I'm supposed to do if", "anything in relation to the Third Leg of", "the", "equation the equation being", "Estuary", "TLC and", "conferences and from the conference in", "Chino we", "learned that a conference can can be an", "amazing bridge between those two", "populations between people that are", "primarily involved with each other", "online and who who need to see in person", "these other people and would be

other hand the estuary", "Community quite frankly if I in my own", "Estuary Group which is usually just shy", "of 12 but it often reaches the number of", "12 and we've had more than that and that", "gets a little unwieldy but", "um if I were to ask those people", "so would you would you like to uh", "organize a big conference where where we", "could like be together with several", "hundred people and uh and and we can we", "can all meet each other and and talk to", "each other and face to face like they", "would look at", "me excuse", "me why would we want to do that we have", "it every

conference or a", "festival they do it to invite other", "people into the experience of", "face-to-face underground inperson conver", "ation because online stuff just doesn't", "cut", "it", "now every time I say that I am fully", "aware that Estuary grew out of TLC and I", "will always be grateful for the roots", "for the encouragement for the visibility", "for your your your your role in in", "announcing this whole thing and to make", "it actually part of the vision to to", "have these people meet on the ground but", "I have become a broken record and a one", "trick pony I don't care so much about", "what we talk about but it better be in", "person I also want to", "confess", "today that I I I listened to", "um Lance that previous conversation also", "that was brought to my attention uh when", "it was halfway going on and I heard", "Lance say", "you know Estuary is", "wonderful the impers stuff is", "great it's very difficult to have it", "grow so fast that everybody can benefit", "from a local Estuary there just aren't", "enough leaders there aren't enough", "estuaries if every year there were 15", "more estuaries then it would still not", "be enough for everyone to have access to", "a local Estuary although um I I think", "this thing could", "really", "um take off if if enough people catch", "the vision of local uh meetings it could", "grow faster than that anyway but the", "point still is that um yes I confess", "that online estuaries are possible", "provided they are online estuaries which", "means using the protocol and not coming", "with a prepared agenda because when soon", "as soon as somebody shows up with with a", "prepared agenda it becomes a discussion", "and it is no longer a conversation and", "then it becomes a somebody has an axe to", "grind or a pony in the race or something", "that they want to see happen and then it", "is no longer the the the fluid organic", "coming together and sharing what's on", "your mind", "today so having made this confession I", "now go back to Estuary and to", "conferences and conferences being that", "bridge", "where Estuary people who want to reach", "out to other people and expand the", "vision of the

each other", "three-dimensionally instead of", "two-dimensionally and uh those two are", "natural they they these these two groups", "naturally find each other in", "conferences and I think you shared that", "Vision with me in Chino quite well and", "for some reason due to the success of", "the Chino conference I have become", "somewhat of a I I now have", "credentials to uh to speak knowledgeably", "about s or about", "conferences and so but at the same", "time this just gets added to my long", "list of activities and duties and", "responsibilities and I am not really I", "don't have the", "bandwidth to uh um to do this", "so quite frankly the the the big", "announcement today is that", "um that has to do with why Nate is here", "the big announcement is", "that to keep the forward momentum of", "estuary not not TLC I have no pony in", "the TLC race if that is going to be", "built and built out and expanded in any", "way possible it's up to you Paul and", "your cohorts and all the sub channels to", "do it not up to me I'm going to just", "occasionally drop in here and there and", "have fun with it but but that's not that", "is not my I don't see that as my", "responsibility at all but I really", "really am very invested in estuaries", "continuing to expand and develop and", "grow and and so that is going to require", "a certain amount of energy that I don't", "have but I really care about", "it so I have a vision that uh if I", "gather the right people around me who", "share that passion who share that Vision", "then maybe in two years I can walk away", "from it and say you know you guys can", "handle this from here on forward and you", "you you are sufficiently capable of all", "the details to uh to to take this thing", "to the next level and guess who is a", "member of that", "team there's seven people I will not", "announce their names today we're going", "to have a more uh elaborate roll out", "than that but the the the team actually", "made a decision two decisions actually", "we had some bit of a division of roles", "and uh when it came to what is going to", "be our position and our responsibility", "and our relationship to conferences as", "the I the the cabal even has a name", "guess what it's called write this down", "I'm I'm ready to type ELC", "[Laughter]", "oh boy we got TLC which is of course The", "Learning Channel and tender loving care", "and now we have", "ELC which is the Estuary Leadership", "Council this came from uh who does this", "come from Nate I think was was it Emily", "that suggest there Emily all right", "Emily okay so so that means that we have", "now already revealed another", "name but ELC has decided on some", "different roles some different people", "are going to be taking care of different", "parts of the of the of the the total", "scope of responsibility and one of the", "things that was most clear was that we", "have one person eminently qualified to", "take care of the liaison between Estuary", "and TLC when it comes to", "conferences and that is Nate", "Hy here he", "is but but but Nate is also here to", "announce a decision which as a council", "we made and told Nate to disclose to", "your audience today Paul and the", "decision is what", "Nate are you talking about like what", "like the dision made about exactly in", "what way we want to encourage and", "support conferences is that no no no no", "no no no no no no that that we will not", "organize any conferences", "right we're we're that's well yes", "correct yes we're not going to we're not", "going to organize the", "conferences um but um we can give", "advice and help you out in other ways", "but we will not organize them that's a", "big decision because this is this this", "this conversation has been going around", "for years now and it's been interesting", "to watch it go so um so Jacob we are not", "it so the", "ELC are not conference organizers they", "are conference organizer", "supporters kind of analogous to the way", "elnet isn't really running estuaries", "they're just supporting leaders I think", "that's a very good analogy Paul I think", "that's that's precisely what we have in", "mind so we can kind of like give people", "advice as to as to how to do it and but", "won't actually be involved in the", "organization of the conferences why", "don't now I know that's going to be a", "little controversial in the minds of a", "few people that already um that we won't", "necessarily name right now but if we", "haven't already but let's let's talk a", "little bit more about that", "because it's it's helpful to understand", "why make a decision like that I can", "understand you know perhaps within the", "group why there was some debate about", "that because it seems natural if you say", "okay well this group is going to", "organize conferences and these are going", "to be ELC conferences or estuary doin", "conferences", "why what talk to me about that decision", "and some of the I mean because there", "there are good reasons on both sides", "here because if you sort of centralize I", "and institutionalize it you can get I", "actually one of the videos I didn't make", "last week was all of this thinking about", "persons and institutions and why we love", "and Trust institutions even though", "sometimes we learn to distrust in", "institutions like we learn to distrust", "people what's that about tell tell me", "more about that that discussion and and", "why the decision was made as it", "was it originally arose out of the", "possibility that some of the leftover", "money from Chino you see if you do a", "conference right you may even have some", "money left", "over that some of the leftover money", "from Chino could be used as startup", "money for other conferences or in other", "ways uh provide scholarships or uh help", "with uh whatever uh you know so in other", "words all of a sudden it became", "attractive to think that one conference", "could uh help facilitate another conf", "conference", "financially and we said well where's the", "end of that and what if you run out of", "money and then who is going to be um", "then who is going to be funding", "additional conferences when the money", "runs out so um we decided for that", "reason alone it would not be a very good", "idea but also that and this is where", "that script that I sent you guys kind of", "comes in because different people do", "different conferences for different", "reasons yes and that is the organic part", "in TLC which I love and and you know um", "Chad", "is this is just", "amazing Chad was really on my case early", "on that I should establish more Central", "traditions and the script and a protocol", "and blah blah blah blah blah and and you", "know centralized leadership and and all", "this kind of stuff or I don't know if", "I'm representing him here correctly and", "then the other day I heard him say Well", "I don't believe that way anymore I I now", "very much believe in the organic let it", "happen and in due time it'll all happen", "and and I I thought that was a lovely", "sentiment and and and and Paul you and I", "have talked about this quite a bit um", "you know how much shall we push this", "thing and how much shall we just let it", "happen and and so I did not think and I", "I I did not expect that my age and my", "energy level would ever become a fact", "in making some of these kinds of", "decisions but now it has for real I mean", "this is an existential need I can't I", "can't keep up with you the reason why I", "didn't get to go to the second German", "festival is because I can't freaking", "keep up with you long legs on on British", "Railway stations Subway paths and what", "have you I mean I I just about killed", "myself that other year and so I I'm not", "prepared to do that anymore I'm just not", "going to do it so I'm too old for this", "crap but that also me means that now", "comes a moment an existential moment in", "time when you can anticipate that hey I", "am not going to be in this particular", "role I can't do this or that or that", "well who else is going to do it and as", "soon as you ask the question who else is", "going to do it then you are then you", "need to begin to think about well who", "are the people who are", "willing have the expertise have the", "motivation have the credential have the", "connections to step up and say yeah we", "can we can do that and we want to do", "that and so the team that I now have", "we've had three meetings already it is", "an incredible team and this is the team", "that had the discussion about why we", "would not do conferences as such which", "is not to say that we're not going to do", "anything so again Nate you take it away", "there's a reason why Nate is the contact", "person for the liaison for for uh", "between ELC and", "TLC Nate is the liazon between", "EC e ELC and", "TLC that's his that's his", "task right and I think that's just", "because I have I think I'm have my hands", "kind of equally in both totally to a", "very clear so it makes sense for which", "people might not notice just by you know", "watching you on Grail country they see", "you online in TLC but a lot of estuary", "is sort of not Estuary by Design is not", "really on screen right", "right off screen I'm very involved in in", "EST and always have been and in terms of", "the organic the organic growth thing I", "like I'm 100% on the same page with e", "John in fact I think that the first", "conversation we had when we met up in", "Chino was about exactly that about us", "both having that Vision that it needs to", "be something that's allowed to grow", "organically um and although it was a", "nice idea to have a Pay It Forward model", "to help support um", "other conferences it's just there are", "there are more downsides to that", "ultimately and also part of that is one", "of the reasons we came to that", "conclusion is that very few conferences", "actually are in the black most of them", "are most of them are in the red so yeah", "there's there's significant financial", "risk in saying I want to do a conference", "and you know I walked through this with", "Katherine I walked through this with", "John I mean at this point I've walked", "through this with enough people that I", "know that all the excitement we're going", "to do a conference and they announce it", "we do some videos yada yada yada and", "then about four months before the", "conference they're like what if nobody", "comes I'm on the hook for this venue I'm", "on the hook for this food I'm on the", "hook for this and if nobody buys tickets", "I'm gonna be upside down for this thing", "for not a little money and so it's a big", "deal yeah I would advise on that just it", "to know how much you can afford to spend", "up front and work that into your budget", "when you're and ask the question who is", "organizing this", "conference it is really important that", "you know who the wi is when you say we", "are going to have a conference when you", "say we you cannot assume that Paul will", "do it for you you cannot
